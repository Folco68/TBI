+ decrease data file size using UTF-8 instead of UTF-16
+ offer to remove replaced TB when adding a new one (merge keywords?)
+ remove new warnings...
+ set buddies for fast access in TB edition dialog
+ check that there is no duplicate TB
+ don't fill fields with garbage on user drop
+ tooltip with date format in new TB dialog
+ change MainWindow::addTB by adding a "nocheck" version, called on program startup (with default arg)
+ add a command line switch to force database check at startup
+ MainWindow::addTB: read TB* only once

+ when dropping a TB, indicate if there is already a previous version in the DB
+ set "Update old TB and merge keywords" as the default button of the Replace Previous TB dialog
+ add a version number to the db file (ATM, the file begins with TB count, so put (int)0 + magic + version would be a solution to identify unversionned DB)
+ add Ctrl+F to focus the search field of the main window
+ document the version formats
+ compile against MSVC (better integration with MSW?)
o implement bool MainWindow::checkStream(QDataStream&) to remove code duplication (not done because few space to save, some specific cases, ...)
+ download documentation depending of its availability
+ rename "RM URL" to "tech pub URL", everywhere (Settings, DlgSettings, MainWindow, ...)
+ be consistent in local vars naming (lower case or camel case)
+ at startup, updateUI() is called twice per TB + once when the MainWindow is populated
+ make download menus dynamic
+ complete commentaries
+ put the readme in an external file
+ complete the readme with version, Qt Framework version etc... before integrating it to DlgHelp
+ integrate Github changelog
+ download TB (pdf) and CTI (TB + "_CTI")
- download everything in a dedicated location when saving the TB
- separate TB index and UI (a singleton holding all the TBs?)
- RT search starts to show some slight lags with around 450 TB. Perform the search in a thread separated from the UI
- add a message at first run, saying to delete the database if the user does not want the shared one (key already created in Settings.hpp). Add the version in the registry, reset FirstRun tag when bumping to a new version
- ForceDBCheck not handled anymore
- properly handle a backup file which could not be deleted on save
- intercept QCoreApplication::aboutToQuit() to properly clean thread and other data
- index opening: don't use a hardcoded value to emit messages about progress
- ask the index opening thread to terminate if the user wants to close the program
- set Settings::firstRun properly
- integrate the target machines in the TB? Need to update file format
- add the URL of the external repo in BeforeRelease.hpp
