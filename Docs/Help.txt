-------

The goal of this program is to

- use official release data and custom keywords to easily find a publicated kit
- browse the official TB page in one clickfile:///C:/Users/FRDEMOLINSM/OneDrive/Dev/TBI/Dialog/DlgHelp.ui
- download the documentation of a kit in one click

You can also Copy the full content of a TB mail and paste it into the main window (Ctrl-A + Ctrl-C + Alt-Tab + Ctrl-V).
It will pop the TB creation dialog, filling the fields for you, and offering to customize any field you want.
Validating the dialog will make the TB to be saved in the list and indexed.

By right-clicking on the TB table, you can create, edit or delete a TB.
You also can copy its URL, or open the PIV web page of the TB in your default browser.
